Stokes-shells
=============

Codes to solve Stokes  problem in 3D and calculate the hydrodynamics coefficient for the reduced fluid-structure
interaction problem with a neutrally stable shell.

Description
===========

The codes are based on the use of the `FEniCS
Project <http://fenicsproject.org>`.

* The codes are compatible with the 2019.1.0 release of the FEniCS Project**.

This repository is a supplementary marterial of the paper

*A neutrally stable shell in a Stokes flow: a rotational Taylor's sheet*

by G.Corsi, A.DeSimone, C.Maurini and S.Vidoli}


The paper is currently under review on PRSA
